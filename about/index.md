				I am a graduate student at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado Boulder</a>. My main research interests are in the domain of Deep Learning, Cognitive Science and Machine Perception. I want to solve problems that connect human perception and mindsets using deep learning. I did my bachelors from Thapar University, India.<br>

				During my undergraduate degree, I got the opportunity to work in the area of Cognitive Science and Augmented Reality under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~varun/">Prof. Varun Dutt</a> at <a href="http://acslab.org/">Applied Cognitive Science Laboratory (ACS Lab)</a>, <a href="http://iitmandi.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mandi</a>. As a result of my internship at ACS Lab, I presented 3 research papers at <a href="http://ahfe2016.org/">7th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics Conference (AHFE) 2016</a>, wrote one book chapter (published in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-41627-4_21">Springer</a>) and a journal paper (published in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319471329_Learning_in_an_Interactive_Simulation_Tool_against_Landslide_Risks_The_Role_of_Amount_and_Availability_of_Experiential_Feedback">Natural Hazards Earth System Sciences</a>). <br>

				At AHFE conference, I attended many other presentations and met new people as well. I was fascinated at the kind of problems that exist in the world and the variety of ways in which different researchers approach those problems. This experience was one of my prime motivation to pursue research and learn how to solve problems.<br>

				Apart from research, I love helping people to maximize their potential. I am also into photography, hiking, traveling, reading psychology books and playing piano. Here are my instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/akshit1995/">akshit1995</a>) and 500px (<a href="https://500px.com/akshitarora">akshitarora</a>) profiles. I am working on making a travel journal, <a href="https://aroraakshit.github.io/adam-blog/">PhotoBooks</a> and couple of other interesting side projects. Hoping to complete them soon.<br>
