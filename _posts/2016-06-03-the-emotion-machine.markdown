<p>This post is inspired from the book "The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind" by Marvin Minsky, a mathematician, computer scientist, and pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. He died at the age of 88, January 26, 2016 (<a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/node/2682">MIT Media Lab</a> | <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/business/marvin-minsky-pioneer-in-artificial-intelligence-dies-at-88.html">NYTimes</a>).</p>

<p>Following are some excerpts from the book that I really found interesting.</p>

<blockquote>If you “understand” something in only one way, then you scarcely understand it at all -- because when you get stuck, you will have nowhere to go. But if you represent something in several ways, then when you get frustrated enough, you can switch among different points of views until you find the one that works for you.
IN AI: If a program works in only one way, then it gets stuck when that method fails. But a program that has several waysd to proceed could then swtich to some other approach, or search for a suitable substitute.</blockquote>

<p>The idea behind the book is firmly opposed to the popular view that each person has a central core -- some sort of invisible spirit or self -- from which all their mental abilities originate. For what seems a demeaning idea -- that all our virtues are second hand -- or that we don't deserve credit for our accomplishments, because they come to us as gifts from some other source. Instead, I see dignity stemming from what we each have made of ourselves: <b>a colossal colllection of different ways to deal with different situations and predicaments.</b></p>

<blockquote>Each of our major ways to think results from turning certain resources ON while turning others OFF and thus changing some ways that our brain behaves.</blockquote>

<p><b>Thinking</b> is basically rational -- dry, detached and logical -- whereas emotions enliven our ways to think by adding irrational feelings and biases.</p>

<blockquote>Each reader reads only what is already inside himself. A book is only a sort of optical instrument which the writer offers to let the reader discover in himself what he would not have found without the aid of the book. -- Marcel Proust 1927</blockquote>
