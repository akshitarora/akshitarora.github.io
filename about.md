<h3>Akshit Arora</h3>
I am Pre-final year Bachelor's of Computer Science and Engineering Student at Thapar University, Patiala, India. I love learning new things from my sorroundings. I am driven by my curiosity to know more about this world.

I started out in machine learning in my first year in college, and since then, it has been a never ending fun for me. This blog comes in as a part of my self-motivation for pursuing ML and AI. 

I intend to play around with basic concepts of machine learning and publish them here as I grow up.

I am also a part of <a href="pratik.acslab.org">Applied Cognitive Science Laboratory</a> at <a href="http://iitmandi.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mandi</a>. My main interests are Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Sciences. We are working on a research tool: an Interactive Landslide Simulator. Feel free to check it out. -> <a href="http://pratik.acslab.org" title="Interactive Landslide Simulator">http://pratik.acslab.org</a>

Research apart, I also love photography and listening to music. And I am always looking out for opportunities around travel, exploration and adrenaline rush ;)

Blog still under development, more improvements coming soon!
